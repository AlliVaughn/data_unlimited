## data unlimited:  A simple tutorial app for beginning web dev/design 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This app was part of a workshop in March, 2017 for ChickTech in Austin, Tx.  

We used a Cloud 9 IDE for development,  Git & Github for a repository,  and Heroku for deployment.  
The girls learned about the development process,  how to fashion a basic layout for a page, the interaction between html, css, JS and libraries, and how data is displayed.
